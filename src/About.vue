      As a first-year student in divinity school, I've been simultaneously amused, frustrated, and edified 
      by the vast array of theological jargon I've encountered. To <i>lean into</i> the amusing side of
      my new vocabulary, I've created this theology-themed version of
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle">Wordle</a>.
    </p>
  
    <h3>Where do the target words come from?</h3>
    <p>
      I selected them from a corpus of all the nine-letter words used in my first-year divinity school course materials.
      Some of the target words are explicitly related to theology, while others are simply over-represented in theological writing.
    </p>
    
    <h3>What words can I guess?</h3>
    <p>
      You can guess any nine letters. You could say this is because I was lazy in my coding, but I prefer to say I'm 
      <i>abstaining from bracketing your generative potentialities</i>.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Why nine letters instead of five?</h3>
    <p>
      Because longer words are <s>clearly</s> incontrovertibly better! (At least, one would think so based on my course readings.)
